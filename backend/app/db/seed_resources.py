Seed learning resources to the database.

This module seeds the learning_resources table with:
- API resources: APIs that can be integrated for dynamic resource fetching
- Website resources: Static links to learning platforms and resources

API Resources:
- YouTube Data API: Already integrated via app/services/agents/resource_finder_agent/agent.py
- CareerOneStop Web API: Integration available via app/services/external_apis.py
- Credential Engine Registry API: Integration available via app/services/external_apis.py

To use API resources:
1. Register for API keys at the provider's website
2. Add API keys to your .env file (e.g., CAREERONESTOP_API_KEY=...)
3. Use the integration functions from app/services/external_apis.py
